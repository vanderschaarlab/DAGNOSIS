# DAGnosis: Localized Identification of Data Inconsistencies using Structures

This repository accompanies the AISTATS'24 paper: "DAGnosis: Localized Identification of Data Inconsistencies using Structures".

### Usage
We suggest creating a new environment before using the code, e.g. with:
```shell
conda create --name dagnosis python=3.10
```
We can then install the package from source:
```shell
pip install .
```

#### Synthetic
We illustrate how to use DAGnosis in a synthetic setup, via the files in the folder `experiments/synthetic`.
The bash scripts `run_linear.sh` and `run_mlp.sh` run the full pipeline: generate the data, train the conformal estimators, and test the conformal estimators, for linear and MLP SEMs respectively. The bash commands for these must be run from inside the `experiments/synthetic` directory.

To compute the inconsistency detection metrics (F1, Precision, Recall), go to the folder `experiments/synthetic` and run:
```shell
python compute_metrics.py PATH_SAVE_METRIC=path_metrics
```
where `path_metrics` denotes the folder where the metrics are saved.

Similarly, you can reproduce the sensitivity experiment by going to the folder `experiments/synthetic/sensitivity` and using the script `run.sh`, followed by
```shell
python compute_metrics.py PATH_SAVE_METRIC=path_metrics
```

#### UCI Adult Income
To run the experiments on the UCI Adult Income dataset, go to the folder `experiments/adult`.
In order to train and test the conformal estimators, run
```shell
python train_test_adult.py
```
The artifacts will be saved in the folder `artifacts_adult`.
Then, the results can be obtained by executing:
```shell
python proportion_flagging.py
```
which will print the list of downstream accuracies and proportions of samples flagged (Figure 3 a) and b)).
